        I was born in Lagos in a family of seven we were raised by both of our parents.
        I attended a government school here at Lagos, my stay in secondary school for six years
        was an all shade of awesome experiences. I scaled through those times and came out victorious.</p>

        <p> After my stay in school i went to work in a school as a teacher for a while.
        So my brother introduced me to Altschool, he wanted me to attend Altschool and become a techie
        seeing how our world revolved around computer and tech. I agreed to his idea and i am here now, 
        ready to go through this journey i have gotten my Altschool id <b>ALT/SOE/023/3888</b> and
        some other prerequisites.</p>

       <p> Curious of my next phase with Altschool, and striving to become a world class software engineer
        with the help of Altschool. So with every iota of my strength i plan to give 
        flesh to my brothers idea.</p>
